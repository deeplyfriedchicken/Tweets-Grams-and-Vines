## How to Use
* Run `python lab3.py filename.txt`
* This generates the JSON and Huffman code in pretty json.
* Check *huffpressed.txt* for the compressed file.

## Analysis
* Despite inputting two dictionaries, the compressed file is considerably smaller (from 45K to 24K).
* Compression time is reasonably fast even with printing on the terminal.
