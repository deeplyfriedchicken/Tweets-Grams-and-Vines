Hello.
My name is leslie knope,and I work for the parks and recreation department.
Can I ask you a few questions? Would you say that you are enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself,or having no fun and no enjoyment? I'm gonna put "a lot of fun.
" Ms.
Knope! There's a drunk stuck in the slide.
Sir,this--this is a children's slide.
You're not allowed to sleep in here.
You know,when I first tell people that I work in the government,they say,"oh,the government.
The government stinks.
The lines are too long at the dmv.
" But now things have changed.
People need our help.
And it feels good to be needed.
- Could you put your arms to your side? - **** - And that might help you slide down a little easier? - *** Do you want to come this way? - Okay,we're gonna need you to get out.
- Can you please go away? Get out of the slide.
- Okay?You'reHere we go! - Can you please go away? Okay,wake up.
Here we go.
Out of the slide.
You know,government isn't just a boys' club anymore.
Women are everyw re.
It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Hillary clinton.
Sarah palin.
Me.
Nancy pelosi.
We did it! You know,I-- I like to tell people,you know,"get on board and buckle up,"bause my ride'sgonna be a big one.
If "andyou get motion sickness,"you know,put your head between your knees 'cause leslie knope's stopping for no one.
Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
And that is tonight.
- That is tonight.
- Right.
Leslie will be running it.
And we need one more.
Who wants in? Tom.
Fine.
This is a great thing for you guys to see.
This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
When I go through these doors,I need to be on.
Like the white house press secretary.
Are you ready? - Yeah.
-Okay.
Here we go.
It's locked.
Okay.
Here we go.
Thank you so much for coming.
What an amazing turnout.
My name is leslie knope.
I am the deputy director of the parks and recreation department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as-- hello? We're having a meeting in here.
Does anybody have any questions about permits? So take two.
I'm leslie knope,and with me is department member tom haverford.
We are here to answer any and all of your questions.
So fire away.
Well,it's a great day,because,uh,last month they put me in jail.
That's right.
The,uh,the head of the police is a ninth-degree mason.
But the music is so loud.
Stop the graffiti,please.
Please.
I don't like obscenities ju-- just as much as you don't like them.
No,it drives me crazy.
I have kids.
hey,My And the guy's,"you My,You Head.
" These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me.
Now,I have a few t ngs I want to say about laura linney.
Thank you so much,barry.
Always great to have you here.
Anyone else who would like to contribute-- I'm ann perkins.
Uh,I'm a nurse,and frankly,I don't really care for politics.
uh,but,um,I'm-- I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on sullivan street.
Excellent.
That sounds like a good idea.
Tell us about that.
No,it's a problem.
It almost killed my boyfriend.
Yeah.
There's a lot nearby my house,and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt.
So there's just this giant pit,and it's been there for almost a year.
Yeah,and,um,my boyfriend,who is a musician-- actually, I support him-- but anyway,he fell in and broke both his legs.
Ann,let me speak with you for a minute.
So your boyfriend fell down into this pit,right? Yes.
And,um,this guy-- is it pretty serious?Are you guys living together? Yes.
Uh,I'm sure this must be really tough for you.
You know,just-- this guy-- sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.
He's just weak.
You have to take care of him.
- You probably feel like you need to move on.
- Why-- what does this-- Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body,just in-- Are you--are you actually hitting on me right now? Oh,oh,god,no.
I'm not-- I'm not hitting on you.
I'm actually married.
I'm just an open person,and I like connecting with people.
I'm,you know,very comfortable around women,attractive women.
I've spent a lot of time with them.
And I just-- I--I don't know.
I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
You know,maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.
Look.
I'd love to do it.
The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly,and it's dangerous,and it's government-owned,and you need to do something about it.
Okay.
- I'll do something about it.
- Really? Yes,we-- I will help you.
Is that a promise? It's more than a promise.
It's a pinky promise.
I pinky promise all of you that I will help,and I will go to that location tomorrow and we will fill in that pit,and then when that's done,we're gonna put a park on the land.
Okay.
Well,I've worked at the parks department for six years,and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.
Recently I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.
But this pit-- the chance to build a whole new park from scratch-- this could be my hoover dam.
No,that sounds great.
Um,problem is,anything over $25 I have to report.
So,um,maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her,maybe she'll give 'em to me.
Morning.
All right,mr.
Mayor.
That sounds good.
I'll see you on saturday for the,uh,ultimate frisbee game.
Bye.
Leslie,hello.
You were talking to the mayor? Yep,we was rappin' about some things.
Tom and I work really well together.
We're both outsiders.
I'm a woman,he's A oh,I think he's a libyan.
I am from bennettsville,south carolina.
I am what you might call a "redneck.
" Okay,brainstorm.
How do we make this park happen? Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
No,parks are not a priority.
I need more firepower.
I need bigger guns.
You know what I need to do?Form a committee.
Right? Yeah,that could work.
Yeah,'cause committees are power,and committees make things happen.
Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
That's really good.
Write that down.
Yep.
From time to time,when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase,I have tom write it down.
He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Here's leslie's quote from wednesday.
Okay,read it back to me.
"committees cover our democracy with blood.
" Sounded better when I said it.
It's still good,though.
Okay,I have an idea.
What about bringing mark on board? - Which mark? - Which mark? Mark brendanawicz.
Which mark? Well,if you want something done in this town,you call mark brendanawicz because, you know,he's a city planner,but he's more than that.
He's kind of like a fixer.
He fixes things.
He's a smart,capable guy.
He just--he knows where the bodies are buried.
What's up,brendanawicz? You crazy old polish person.
City hall is like a locker room,and you gotta get in there and you gotta snap towels at people and you gotta give 'em the business,and if you can't take it, you know,you--you-- then you can't take it.
You--you gotta leave the locker room.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
I just work right there.
Well,thank you for clearing your schedule.
Oh,I didn't clear anything.
You know this lot that I'm talking about,right? Uh,yeah,lot 48.
Um,condo developer.
He dug a basement and then he went bankrupt.
I checked it out like a month ago.
It's pretty gross.
What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park? A park,huh? Okay.
Well,when I think about the logistics,the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through ,I would say-- is it likely? No,it's not likely,you know.
But is it possible? No.
It's not possible.
I would give up on that one.
What?Why? Why?Uh,I don't know.
There's,like,a million reasons why.
Uh,homeowners' associations,anti-government nuts,bureaucrats,miles of red tape-- Really?It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
There's no way it can happen.
I can do this.
I just need a little help.
Could you do me a favor? For old times' sake? Mark and I-- it's complicated.
When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar worldview and you're passionate about the same things,things can happen.
We slept together.
Leslie? No.
Oh,my god.
You know what? Yeah,we did,like five years ago.
I'd sort of-- No,but yeah.
Yeah.
We did.
Honey,can you straighten up your area a little bit? 'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Can-- thanks.
That parks lady is coming over and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.
I--I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
I mean,I don't think anybody in government actually cares about-- Honey,do you mind doing that somewhere else? I'm trying to watch tv.
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
It's ms.
Perkins' house.
Doorbell! Yeah,I heard it.
Doorbell! I heard it.
I'm getting it.
I'm here.
Look at that.
Safety.
You remember tom from last night.
- Hey,ann,how are you? - Yeah,hey.
Of course I do.
And this is our college intern,april.
She's going to be documenting our fact-finding mission.
Hey,april.
Is this fun for you? Yeah,it's so much fun.
Uh,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
This must be our hero.
The man heard 'round the world.
How you doin',son? Pretty good.
I'm leslie knope.
And the entire government of pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Could you pass me my itch stick? Of course.
So,um,andy jumped over this fence.
He was crossing through to get home and then he fell right there.
Oh,my god.
How did we let this happen? Dream with me for a second,ann.
Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park? Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings,pool,tennis courts, volleyball courts,racquetball courts,basketball court,regulation football field.
We could put an amphitheatre over there with shakespeare in the park.
It's really not that big of a pit.
We could do some of those things.
It's gonna take a little extra work.
But why not try? I think that would be great.
Me,too.
I'm going in.
- Why? - 'T w donorry.
I have a hard hat on.
- I can see that,but-- Yeah.
- April,document this.
- Okay,why? The key to any fact-finding mission is to get right into the battle zone,you know? It's like george bush when he flew over new orleans or richard nixon when he went to china to see what the chinese were up to.
No.
Leslie,are you okay? Leslie! Hold o april's gonna get some photos for the website.
Can you just be still? Don't move around as much.
Okay,squeeze my fingers.
Good.
Does it hurt a lot? No.
I'm fine.
No,you're not.
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
But it-- it fell off.
After my head hit that rod.
I can't believe you fell in,too.
That's awesome.
It's not awesome,andy.
Well,at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.
It's not broken.
It is.
Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things? Honestly,you're-- you're fine.
Oh,honestly,my clavicle's broken.
Oh,hey,baby,if you're going to the kitchen,could you make me pancakes real quick? Uh,sure.
Ooh,are pancakes being made? Yeah,sure.
I don't know,she's a little doofy.
But she's sweet.
Ron,please.
No.
No way.
Come on,ron.
I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Give me my shot.
Let me have lot 48.
Is that a travel pillow around your neck? Ron,I don't know how to explain this to you.
When you've been down in the pit-- have you been in the pit? No,I haven't gotten down there yet.
- Well,I have.
-When you fell in.
When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact-finding mission.
And when you're down there,you get some perspective about what it all means.
And let me tell you something,ron.
What it means is I want this subcommittee.
I've been quite open about this around the office.
I don't want this parks department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
����chuck E.
Cheese.
(������ ��Ϸ��������һ���Ĵ���������ͥ��������) ������������ȱ����ҵģʽ ����Ը��chuck E.
Cheese���� Well,I will definitely think about it.
I like the sound of that "definitely.
" I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Mr.
Swanson,I presume.
Lot 48.
Thoughts? Yes?No?Me? Park?Giving the park to me? Still mulling.
She's insatiable.
She's like A little dog with a-- a chew toy.
All right,you guys.
All right,all right.
I'll ask him.
Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Someone on the phone about the park.
You know,I don't think I even want it.
Oh,man.
The clavicle's still really hurting me.
this is a great shot.
I know.
That's awesome.
I think she's crying in that one.
Look at this one.
Hey,kids.
That's another good one.
Hey,brendanawicz.
You gotta come check this out.
Leslie took us out to that pit in lot 48 and she fell inside.
And we have some awesome photos.
- Uh,is she okay? - Yeah,she's fine.
Oh,this is a classic.
That's the best one.
The up-skirt photo.
Awesome.
Hey,man.
Give me the photo back.
What's going on? Don't worry.
I can print more.
Leslie is unique.
Um,government work can beat you down.
I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Leslie's kept hers for six years.
I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.
I want you to give lot 48 to leslie so she can try to build a park.
Why should I? You owe me one,remember? Do you want to cash in for this? Yeah,I do.
So this was built in 1935.
It's called pioneer hall.
A little trivia-- it is one of the first structures in america to ever have locks.
Oh,yeah.
This is our crown jewel.
It's one of our best murals.
It depicts the very famous battle at conega creek.
We have a lot of children visit,so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.
That is horrifying.
Yes,it is.
So what do you want to see?The dmv?Animal control? - Or we could-- Leslie.
We did it.
Ron's approved our committee.
- Oh,m D.
-That's great! - That's so great.
-That's so exciting! This is huge.
I'm barely 34,and I've already landed a parks department exploratory subcommittee.
I'm a rocket ship.
Leslie.
I just heard the news.
- Isn't it great? - Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm so excited.
It's exciting,isn't it? - It is.
- Yeah.
Should I call a press conference now,or? - Yeah,call one.
Definitely.
- I would.
Every now and then we have these little gatherings and leslie gets plastered.
One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a fruit roll-up.
She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.
On halloween,she was dressed up as batman.
Not batgirl.
Batman.
And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
And it is my favorite thing in the world.
You know what?America is awesome.
It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
- Yeah.
-You gotta be ready for it.
- Yeah.
- Are you excited? - Definitely am.
Fired up.
- Yeah! I'm really fired up.
I--you know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well,I'm getting involved.
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Even if it takes two months.
Soul sista,soul sista - gonna get your phone,sista - Yeah.
Sweet lady marmalard I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.
I don't want to see any double dribble.
I don't want to see any three-second violations.
Bobby knight!
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hos before bros.
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
- You make such good coffee.
- Look, I know you're saying you're okay but I've been in this position before.
And I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't actually.
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
We slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I? I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden.
Right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names.
Right, Tom? - Like this.
What's this? - Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there? - Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this? What do you think? Carrots? If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Some kind of spice? You know, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my text? Did you get my emails? Did you see that I paged you? I did not.
Did you check your voicemail? I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints on the manure.
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but give me one day to deal with this internally, okay? - Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it successfully, but this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head or torso, I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this kingpin? It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal, 'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants "rid neighborhood of drugs, "earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone.
" We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something? No, get it from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip? Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
- I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.
Are you gonna wear that shirt? Yeah.
You like it? Tommy Hilfiger? No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Everyone thinks it's Hilfiger.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.
I have to figure out how this works.
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now we just need to take a test shot - and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot.
Ready? - Focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the - Stop.
Focus up right where the weed Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Look, it's Mark.
What are you doing? What? I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Are you ready? Oh, no, I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously? 'Cause I think the movie starts in like You're joking around right now.
This is gonna be fun.
You know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains too.
That was silly.
Are they dating now? Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life: hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying, nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "nuh-uh, no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
'I don't need your business here.
" Get down! Working late? Shovel guitar Shovel guitar Somebody wants to play shovel guitar Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Bucket drum Bucket drum - You're not from here, right? - No, I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where? - My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya? I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name Haverford come from? My birth name is Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
- What about Barack Obama? - Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was gonna be elected president, - Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear that? It's the kingpin.
Write this down.
White male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy, come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here? It's so good to see you.
- Quietly.
- What happened? - You're living in the pit now? - For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody planted a garden down there with fruits and vegetables, - so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Don't look at me.
There's weed down there? I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay? Why don't you come helping us? To catch the guy.
You could tell us what you've seen.
I'm supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Do you live here? Yeah, do you live here? Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS? No, I'm safe.
Blindness? Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee? I have a hernia.
- Do you have syphilis? - I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital? Yes, please.
But I rode my bike, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
- You still here? - I wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here? It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann? She's doing good? I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
- How's she doing? - Doing good tonight.
She's out on a Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm gonna need more if I'm gonna stay up.
- Is that candy? - It's a necklace made out of candy.
- Want one? - Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables for weeks now.
Oh, my God.
You know there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high.
Sugar hit high.
Sugar high.
High.
Are you okay? Sugar slam.
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
I'm in.
Bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So that was fun.
Yeah, it really was.
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what, I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No.
Just watch watch what I'm gonna do.
Ask me in for a nightcap.
- Will you come in for a nightcap? - Yes, I will.
No, no, damn.
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.
Wait.
Look.
That guy's trying to break into that van.
It does look like he's breaking into that van.
- 911.
- Hi, there.
So, do you like spy on Ann? From the pit? I just like being nearby.
That way if she wants me back, I could be at her house in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
You aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she? - What? - Is she dating somebody else? - What? - She's dating somebody else? - I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating? - Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God! I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight? I'm all right, officer.
How are you? I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID? I just told you my ID, so what's the crime here? Parking while Indian? There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into lady-foot locker? I'm very close to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything! I'm a city employee.
- Come on! - Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing? What happened to the guy that was in that van? Cops took him.
What? - My God.
- Ann and Mark! It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this? He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here? If you could just stop writing for a second and focus here, 'cause Ma'am.
As I've already told you, this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
- Nice job with that, but listen - Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van? That's not what happened.
Could you please go home, get some sleep and let this matter be resolved? Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No! - Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me.
- I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave? Can I call you Dave? My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What? I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.
What branch of government are you in? Parks and Recreation.
Do I stutter? It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be a pervert.
That's what people think when they first meet him - but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now? You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure? - Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready? I was born ready.
I'm Ron [beep] Swanson.
Easy.
Care Careful! Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What? Is this your house? Where are we? You're awake? - Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really? Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you.
Understand? - OK.
So where's that marijuana at? It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually it was there.
These are carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana? Is that the house there where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from? I get it.
What? You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner? Want to go get some breakfast? What? No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you? Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on! I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home! Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing? Eating? Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
1 Oh, God! Hey, Boo Boo Bear.
What did you just call me? Boo Boo Bear.
It's one of several nicknames I made up for you.
And you can choose which one you like best 'cause I want this to be a give and take.
Okay.
We went out once, and nothing happened.
There is no "this.
" We have Cookie Tush Wow.
Just right out the gate.
Winnie the Boo, Lady Presh Presh, Annberry Sauce, Annie Get Your Boo, Tommy's Girl, Annie Banannie Hey! All right.
Let's do this.
What are you doing? Is this not one of those? I might have misread the vibe.
Oh, my God! Dude.
You have to be cooler about this.
Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend.
But if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's going to make it really hard to know if this is actually anything.
So, just keep it on the DL.
Okay? I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
That is accurate.
Can I at least change my Facebook status to "in a relationship"? Definitely not.
"It's complicated"? Whatever.
Am I in a relationship? It's complicated.
Chief Trumple, nice to see you.
Hi.
Hey, Knope.
Wyatt.
Been a long time, eh, Cap'n? Or Captain.
"Oh, Captain, my Captain.
" From Dead Poets Society.
You getting weird already? Nope.
I'm good.
Pawnee's police chief is retiring and I'm trying to get his endorsement before he goes.
I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
I'm not afraid of cops.
I have no reason to be.
I never break any laws, ever.
Because I'm deathly afraid of cops.
Look, Knope.
I've always liked you.
But the Newports run this town.
And frankly, they've donated a lot of money to the Department.
Well, mo' money, mo' problems.
That's what I always say.
How about mo money, more protective Kevlar vests that save lives? Sometimes, I say that, too.
I understand you need to think about it.
But if you were going to make a decision The guys are throwing me a little retirement thing tonight at O'Flynnigans.
There's going to be beer.
So why don't you swing by and I'll give you an answer? Weirdo can come, too.
All right.
Let's go.
Oh, hey.
Uh May I say that the boys in blue Don't.
Stop.
are heroes.
Obviously, some more than others.
Oh, boy.
Here it comes.
And we're walking.
Okay.
Listen up, people.
This is very serious.
Jerry, if you're eating you're not listening.
Thanks, babe.
I don't know how many of you have heard, but there is a flesh-eating virus going around.
Yeah.
It's called music.
And there's only one way to get a vaccine.
And that is to play it.
To play the You get an injection.
Just say your piece, son.
I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
It's called Catch Your Dream and it's amazing.
It's kind of like We Are the World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society.
Here's the thing.
We need back-up singers.
And I thought, who better to be back-up singers than Leslie's campaign team? Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
My job is the song.
She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fundraising barbecue, and I dropped them all.
All of them.
Like, 1,000.
Sol really want to do a good job.
So, we're going to record this bitch tonight.
Double Time Studio.
Double Time, you said? Little brick building over on Liondale Road? Yeah.
You know the one? No.
You could not keep it together in there.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm fine now.
As long as we can get out of here as quickly as possible and never come back.
Hey, Leslie.
Dave.
Hey.
Oh.
my God! Hey.
Wow.
You look great.
San Diego sun.
Got me all tanned up.
So, what are you Oh.
Sorry.
Ben, this is my This is Dave Sanderson.
Oh, hey.
Nice to meet you.
Yes, Leslie Knope is a female person with whom I was involved.
We had, romantic Romantical involvement until I relocated to San Diego.
Which is That's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles.
So, we terminated our involvement at that time.
Are you here for awhile? No, just tonight, for the Chief's retirement thing.
Oh.
Yeah.
We're We're going to that, too, actually.
But we're going to go a little later.
Because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice, new French restaurant.
Cool.
I'm going to go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
Well, see you later.
You should come to dinner with us.
Okay.
I shouldn't have invited him.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no.
No, that's okay.
I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you.
And honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it.
No.
Look, he's here for one night.
He's a really great guy, and he's going to love you.
Which, bonus, will make all the other cops love you.
Dave is a great person.
And he's a great judge of character.
Tonight, he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me.
Double endorsement.
Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie.
Studio's down here.
Let's go.
Hustle, people.
Come on.
Jerry.
That's vandalism.
I have a problem.
This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
I've heard of him.
I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy.
He doesn't want his nosy co-workers discussing his music with him.
Or knowing that he exists.
So if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it.
You got it, Duke.
Don't call me that.
I dig your groovy tunes, man.
Did you hear me? I said, I dig your groovy tunes, man.
Yo, Chuck.
We're going to go ahead and play and sing at the same time.
I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.
So, we have to play it perfectly every time? No, Burly.
Play it unperfectly.
You mean, imperfectly? I mean perfectly.
God, that was hot nonsense.
Yeah.
Hey, can I have a sip of that water? Oh, sure.
Thanks.
That's sweet.
The two of you sharing a nice bottle of You told them.
What? I asked you for one thing.
Fine.
I told them we went on a date.
When? As soon as I possibly could.
l texted them while we were on the date.
I'm sorry.
But you are too hot to hide, Ann.
This is on you.
Hey.
When you two spoon, who spoons who? Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
He's really smart.
You know, a campaign manager is only as good as the campaign person that he is managing.
So I'm trying to say you're a real smart lady.
Oh, you can say that again.
If anything, I'm holding her back.
Aw, Ben.
I said my thing first.
Actually, that's why we were at the police station today.
We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Oh, yeah? Hugh's a buddy of mine.
I could probably get him to endorse you.
Oh, man, that would be amazing.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey.
Excuse me.
I need to use the bathroom.
Oh, you mean the whiz palace.
Yes, Leslie calls it that sometimes.
I know.
It's kind of cute, right? Yeah, that's real cute.
So, how is San Diego I'm still in love with you.
What did you just say? Nothing.
I did Nothing.
Nothing was said.
Nothing was just now Did you just say you were still in love with me? No, I don't think I said that.
Dave, why would you tell me that here and now? Because it's accurate.
And because he's not here right now, so I thought this would be a good time.
Can I just please talk to you about this for five minutes? No.
You cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here.
Okay, well, get rid of him.
That's a good call.
No, bad call.
That's not the call.
I'll tell him.
Okay.
If we leave now while he's in the whiz palace No.
Listen to me.
Hey.
Whizzingham Manor.
That's another funny name for the bathroom that I thought of.
Catch your dream And shackle it to your heart Catch your dream No.
No.
No.
Was that a joke? Were you joking just now? Because if so, that was hilarious-ly awful-ly funny how bad that was.
Why don't you take 15 minutes and really think about whether or not you want to be part of this.
He's a gorgeous genius, people.
Just don't question his methods.
Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins? Oh, are you about to give me the whole, "She's a great girl and you need to treat her right" speech? Since you guys used to date? No.
But she is, and you should.
I just had no idea.
And so, now, I have to adjust.
Okay.
Great talk.
Uh, how's work out there, Dave? Pretty good.
I've caught a lot of bad guys.
About six bad guys.
So, you're leaving tomorrow? I'm scheduled to leave tomorrow on the 12:15 flight through Salt Lake City.
Oh.
It was so good to see you.
But I may be coming back.
How's that now? Well, I'm mainly here to interview for Trumple's job Police Chief.
Dude, that's amazing.
You should totally be Chief.
You could endorse Leslie.
I would definitely endorse Leslie.
You don't have to.
There's a lot of good candidates.
I think I'm going to take a little go outside.
You look like I could use some company.
What? What? Would you like to step outside with me and catch up? We have caught up.
We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
I think we're good.
I could take a little jaunt with you.
No, I don't want that.
Well, I'm already I already said I'm going to go.
So I guess I'm a man of my word.
I'm going to go.
Take your time.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Honestly, how do you think I'm doing? Because I feel like we're getting along He said he's still in love with me.
pretty well.
What's that? When you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me.
Oh, my God.
Leslie, he's a cop.
He's in love with you and he has a gun.
Can you just not freak out? I'm not freaking out.
Okay.
I'm not freaking I know.
That's I know.
It was raining out, so I didn't want to get wet.
I got some hot tea with honey.
Good for the voice.
I recommend you all try it.
Mine's really just a cup of honey because tea is gross.
And here's the thing.
We're going to start from scratch.
We're going to get rid of this whole sucky vibe.
I'm thinking we could To the man! I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe.
See where her head's at? Follow her lead.
That was amazing.
Next thing, I want to hear how all of us sing on our own, so we can figure out where we're going wrong.
This is not an audition, so relax.
But if you don't sing good, you're out of here.
I think you sound like an angel and everyone else sounds like demons.
I think you shouldn't whisper.
Yeah, Ann's mad at me now but I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me.
Chris, you're first.
Sing.
Anything you want.
Let me hear it.
Okay.
Take me out to the ball game Take me out to the game I just want to be at the game I would like to eat at the game I'd like popcorn and candy and the home team at the game Boom.
Here's the check, as you requested.
Here's my credit card.
Quick, now.
The check? Yeah.
You like dessert.
Why didn't you get a dessert? Oh, dessert is overrated and gross.
Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening.
Actually, Ben, would you mind if I talked to Leslie alone? Actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you.
Well, I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to Leslie.
Well, I want to talk to you.
And if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie.
Well, I'd like to talk to Ben.
And then, I'd like the three of us to talk together.
Well, then, I'll talk to Ben, and then you, and then I'll talk to you.
And then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then.
All right.
So who's talking now? Catch your dream Don't let it spread its wings and fly away Stop the song! Stop the song right now.
Please, stop it! Oh, for sake.
Ann, I caught feelings for you.
And I want you to be my girl.
And I don't care who knows.
I know you don't care, dummy.
I care.
Let's not get hung up on who wants what.
You know what? I'm calling this.
We're done.
What about our next date? If you want another date, keep walking away.
She's still walking.
I need you to know something, man to man.
I still have feelings for Leslie, in a womanly fashion.
And I believe she feels the same towards me, in a manly way.
She doesn't feel the same way.
Because she has a boyfriend.
Me.
And we love each other.
That information is It's not pertinent, frankly, at this juncture.
I just said to you one thing.
And you're contriring me.
I don't think that's a word.
I think we'd all appreciate it if you would just let me have three minutes with her alone.
Consequently, I'd like you to clear the area.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm not going to give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me.
I think that that's reasonable.
Okay.
Okay, and I want to thank you.
I want to thank you for having this talk with me, man.
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
What are you doing? I'm doing that.
Are you serious? You brought it on yourself.
What? I got something I've got to say to you.
Where's Ben? He left.
He left? Yeah, he said, "I've got somewhere important to go, "and I don't respect her as a woman.
" He said that.
And then he acted more effeminate than he does in front of you.
Just, look.
I've got some something to say.
And it's emotional.
And it's important.
I need 30 seconds.
Okay.
What? Go ahead.
What is it? Okay.
Romance Hello.
Are you okay? Yeah.
I have to pee really bad, ironically.
What were you thinking? I was thinking that I would cuff him and then I could have time to speak to you.
And that you would decide to be with me, and then I would come back here and we would un-cuff him together.
Can you just un-cuff him, please? I'm sorry.
Would you look at that? Nature is throwing me a bone.
Haverford Playbook move number two.
Ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain.
Like a memory of I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be over-thinking this.
The song has to be perfect, Ron.
Okay? Leslie trusted me with it.
I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I? This is the only way I can help.
Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
That's worked before.
Leslie is going to love it.
I promise.
No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music? Hey.
Take a walk.
Clear your head.
I bet it does you some good.
Ann? Boo Boo? I don't want to say "I told you so.
" But What? I was the one who didn't want to go.
I know.
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
I'm sorry.
He was a very important person to me and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly.
Let's just go home.
No.
We're going to Trumple's thing.
No.
Let's not go there.
I don't care about the endorsement.
And I don't want to put you through this anymore.
You don't care about the endorsement? Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision-making get in the way of this election.
What happened to you? I was waiting outside in the rain for you.
Because I thought you would come out and be like, "Oh, he's all wet.
That's so romantic.
" But you didn't.
And now I've got the sniffles.
What on earth would make you think I would like that? Movies.
Oh, God, Tom.
Why do you have to be so you all the time? I'm sorry.
Will you help me get out of these wet clothes? Hey.
Want a beer? Oh, okay.
If you're driving, I can't give you a beer.
Oh.
Well, then, no, thank you.
It's a celebration, man.
You have to have a drink.
I'll definitely have one.
Don't make a mistake you'll always regret.
Please just tell me what you want me to do.
So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends.
But I love Ben and he comes first.
And if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever.
Okay, that's fair.
I'm sorry.
That was dumb, all that stuff I did.
You just, you make me crazy.
And I guess I'm just surprised that, you know, that's the guy you fell in love with.
He's very Well, he's shrimpy.
And he's small.
Shrimpy or not, he's smart and he's cute and he's kind and he's funny.
He's got a great face and nice hair, and he's Okay, that's I get it.
I surrender.
I just want to know that you're happy and you're protected.
I'm very happy.
And he's not shrimpy.
A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face.
Well, good man.
I mean him, for doing that.
Not the guy who called you a bitch.
You tell me where he is.
I'll punch him, too.
All right, guys.
Here's the deal.
We've got to completely start over.
I wrote a new song.
It's called The Promise of Tomorrow's Wings.
It's brilliant, about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass.
Hey, Chuck.
Go ahead and just delete everything, all right? Hold on, Chuck.
Just listen to the song one more time and then make a decision.
Where is that saxophone coming from? I don't know.
I don't know the first thing about music.
And shackle it to your heart Is that a new mix? It sounds way better.
See? You just needed to clear your head.
Hey.
You guys, who is this? This looks just like Ow, that was loud.
I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is.
No, no! It's paper.
I was reaching for paper.
It's all right, boys.
Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Newport's just going to keep on buying you guys a couple of new cars or some new uniforms, as always.
That guy is all about short-term solutions.
Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace? What's wrong with you? I don't know.
Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great.
But really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's.
And I locked that sucker up a long time ago.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about to endorse 10 beers into my mouth because this has been an incredibly stressful evening.
Nice work, guys.
Hey, a little tradition.
After Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze.
Who's it going to be? All right, look.
I know I messed up.
But there's something I've got to say to you.
No playbook.
No gimmicks.
Just me, Tom, talking to you as a person.
Okay.
I would like that.
Good.
Because this is what I really want to say.
Baby, I'm sorry for how I acted But if you give me another chance I could be the boo of your dreams, girl So when you're sleeping and you're dreaming of a boo I want that boo to be me I want me to be that boo So will you date me? I'm saying Okay.
Yes, fine, fine, fine.
Yes.
I will.
I will go out with you.
Enough.
Please! Really? Yes.
Dude, you wore me down.
Just stop singing.
Please.
The four sweetest words in the English language.
"You wore me down.
" Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Oh, hey, Dave.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, that's all right.
No, no, no.
You're waiting It's your turn.
No.
No, I'm not.
You're not waiting.
No.
It feels like you're It feels to me like you're being overly respectful of all these cops, and you're letting them go in all in front of you.
No, no, no.
I'm just standing here.
Why would you be standing just here? I was just checking Get in that.
Go in! Thank you so much.
Wait, I forgot! - Who the hell is pregnant? - What? I found a pregnancy test at your cabin and I checked with all the girls over there and wasn't any of them.
Hello, darling, what a surprise.
Hey.
Can we talk? Maybe in private.
You and me? I believe she's referring to me, son.
Please excuse us.
So Iam pregnant.
I see.
I don't understand how.
We were so careful.
I warned you about this.
Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.
I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking.
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe-- most likely in a canoe.
I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any.
Ron Swanson.
Diane Lewis will you marry me? Yes.
- On one condition.
- Anything, my love.
Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding.
Just the opposite.
We've both been married before.
I don't want anything big or elaborate.
In fact, the smaller the better.
I assume you can deal with that.
Are you kidding? As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now.
Well, hello there.
Hey, Leslie.
What's with the getup? We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
Where are you guys going? The fourth floor, getting married.
Okey-dokey.
Well, catch you later.
What? Wha-- What--who's-- what the-- Are you dead? You look like you're in rictus.
I just--I'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Would you ladies like to come? - Can I be the best man? - Why not? Let's go.
Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this! Wait! If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake - or a bouncy castle-- - Ah! Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you.
What's the date of the wedding? - Today.
- It's a bit unusual, - but we both-- - Don't care.
Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor? Diane, you have no idea what that means to me.
She gets it.
Let's go.
Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness.
I need to get some flowers.
Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters? Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice.
Why is there no rice in this municipal government building? I found a justice guy.
These are the marrying people.
- This is Carl.
- Hello, Carl.
My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here.
Haven't I done a quickie wedding for you before? It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick.
I need your full names for the license.
- Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
- Diane Tammy Lewis.
Tammy? - Your middle name is-- - Just kidding, it's Elizabeth.
- Let's go, Carl.
- Hey, hey.
Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay? Belay that order, Carl.
Shortest possible ceremony.
I'm tired of not being married to this woman.
Do you, Ron Swanson, take Diane to be your wife? Ooh, it's going to start! Ooh, it's happening! - I certainly do.
- Oh, my God! - And do you, Diane, take-- - Yes! - Yes, I do.
- She said yes! - Okay.
- Wait! - By the power vested in me-- - Before you-- Carl, just one second.
I would just like to give a short speech, if I may.
You have ten seconds.
At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines "friend--" - Time.
- It's--ugh! Thank you, Leslie.
I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful.
- I now pronounce you - Oh! man and wife.
Hooray! Yay! Great job, everyone.
The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.
Pretend this is rice! That was beautiful.
The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
Recall Knope! Recall Knope! Legalize weed! Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle.
The clue--"Who's the worst," but you know what? We're fighting back.
I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
We are currently in phase 26: "No problem too small.
" Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small.
Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today? There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.
I want them gone but not killed--I love animals.
But get rid of them.
They're gross.
But make sure they're happy but not too happy.
Well, we're on it, because "No problem too small.
" So what now? Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face.
- Leslie Knope! - Oh! Ann Perkins.
Mm.
How's the recall fight going? This person-to-person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Well, as a wise woman once said to me, "Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnut-haired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan.
" Good memory, sunfish.
Let's press on.
I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Someone has a slug infestation? Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges.
Life is precious, and every day is a miracle.
Okay.
What a freak.
Things with me and Chris are going really well.
We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun.
And check this out.
Oh, no, there's no ring.
We just had manicures together recently.
Sorry, that was misleading.
Ah, Mr.
Haverford, back again, I see.
What the hell, man? This looks exactly like my store! I know.
My client is a very determined businessman.
When he rips someone off, he goes all the way.
You see, you are Hydrox, Mr.
Haverford.
We are Oreo.
Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy.
I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.
- Mm.
- He must be one heck of a transporter.
My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking.
Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rent-a-swag to try to put me out of business.
I'm not worried, though.
I've poured my heart and soul into my store.
I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.
- It's not Lebron James.
- Damn.
Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think "No problem too small" is working.
I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.
I agree, we need something massive and attention-getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.
- I got it! - What is it? Oh, no, I just-- I got a fly.
I have something.
Remember phase 13, "Think outside of the box"? Of course.
It was an amazing phase.
Easily a top five phase.
Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award.
It's called "The International Coalition of Women in Government," and you won.
There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something.
Oh, my God, this is real.
I just assumed you were lying.
Thank you, but yeah, it's real.
Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think.
Janet Napoli-fraking-tano? Oh, my God.
This is amazing and perfect.
This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention.
When is the ceremony? - Next monthin London.
- London? - London? - We're going to London? We're going to London, you guys! I can't believe we're at Hogwarts! No, that's Buckingham Palace.
Hogwarts is fictional.
Do you know that? It's important to me that you know that.
Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today.
Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history.
History began on July 4, 1776.
Everything before that was a mistake.
Diane suggested we "tag along to London" for a honeymoon.
I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe.
Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her.
All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30.
Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting.
Are you okay? Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee.
It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Leslie, you're in London.
You're 4,000 miles away from home.
- Try to enjoy this, okay? - Yeah, you're right, as usual.
Good luck.
Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early.
Ooh, hold on, actually.
Hang on.
Yeah, no.
I want to quit and never come here again.
Okay, bye.
I can't believe I used to date you! Tommy Pickles! You see there's a better version of your store across the street? And those guys are giving out free pizza with "papperonas.
" I know, man.
That's my competition.
They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working.
Three weeks ago, this place was hopping.
My clothes were flying off the rack.
I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.
Now, look at this place.
It's dead! What am I gonna do? It's like I always say, okay? When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing.
That's not a good piece of advice.
So I'ma throw up.
I ate too much cheese.
I'll talk to you! I need some better friends.
So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer? Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month.
How much beer were you drinking? I know, right? Probably too much.
Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our after-school music program, and British people love me.
There was this British kid in my high school who always called me "Big Ben" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, "Bong! Bong! Bo--" Oh, he might have hated me.
Real quick, should I do a British accent? - Um, I'm gonna say no.
- You sure? - Yeah.
- I can do one.
It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off.
I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.
He knows we're American.
Ugh, great.
All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway.
After all, we did come all the way down under.
No.
Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.
This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir.
Well, it's nice to meet you too.
However, the proper mode of address would be "Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, "14th Earl of Cornwall-upon-Tthames, of Hertfordshire.
" No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
- Oh! - Please, call me Eddie.
Oh, thank God.
I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.
Andy-- No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name.
Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea.
- Shall we? - Yeah.
The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, and--oh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also.
What do we do? Ron, your pick.
Look, a clock.
We don't have that in America.
You call that a tower? Try the Sears Tower, friend.
"London at night.
" That is very funny.
Can I help you, sir? Yes.
I will take this.
We don't accept American currency, sir.
Of course you do.
That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.
Accept it.
Very sorry, sir.
Fine.
Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby.
You really think this will work, Donna? Why wouldn't it? We just pull the business license-- it's public information-- and then at least you'll have an address.
Ooh, here.
Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation - called "Open 4 Business, LLC.
" - Thanks, Donna.
Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane.
- Done and done.
- Nice.
"1020 Maple Street.
" Ann and Chris? What are they doing here? Sir, you can't go in there! Aha! I caught you! - Hey, it's Tom! - What the hell are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing here? Dr.
Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant! Oh, my God.
- You're Jean-Ralphio's dad! - Mm-hmm.
You're the one that's trying to put me out of business! Well, look at that, Mr.
Haverford.
You tracked me down.
Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, high-end fashion rental skills.
Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please? No, you certainly cannot.
Dr.
Saperstein, why are you doing this? What did I ever do to you? You know exactly why I'm doing this.
You destroyed my family.
First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity.
Wait, you're serious? Deadly serious.
According to my daughter, you broke her heart.
Then you smashed up her BMW.
I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School.
Let me tell you something, mister.
You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath.
Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat.
- Ohh.
- Everything sounds perfect.
Ohh.
This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.
And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.
So this after-school music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can-- Whoa! Are those-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are those remote control helicopters? - Yeah.
- What? I got them as a gift.
I bought them for one of my nephews, - and then I decided to keep them.
- Yeah.
Would you like to play with them? Oh, would I? I call blue one! I call the-- oh.
Okay, you get the blue one.
Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington.
Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.
What are you talking about, dude? - I called it.
- He called it.
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule.
Anyway, the orange one's better.
- What? - Come on.
Aah! Hey, get off! Okay, watch out! Watch out! - Agh! - Ohh! Dude, awesome.
I think I broke mine! - Oh, bummer.
- So, like, you your family owns all this stuff? Well, no, not everything.
We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one.
We don't own that.
Oh, no, actually, we do own that.
What else does your family own? Well, um, have you heard of Scotland? As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a wide-reaching international program.
Oh, you know what I want? Ice cream.
Do you guys have that here, ice cream? Oh, it's so good.
You have to get it.
It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone.
- Yeah.
- Do you have that here? - We have it.
Of course we-- - You have it? Where do you think you are, the moon? - That'd be awesome if we were.
- Yeah.
Can we get some? Could we do--could we have some? Could we? Sure.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Just what do I do with this? Just throw it there.
Roger will pick it up.
Oh.
"So I long for a day "when women in government will simply be seen "as people in government, but until then, "I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be.
" What do you think? I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes.
Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know? I want to know what's happening there.
One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.
Ms.
Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her.
What? What now? Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light.
We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope? She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.
How--how did they get that picture so Facebook.
- But I just put-- - Facebook.
- But isn't it a-- - Facebook.
Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in.
Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed.
Oh, my God.
You're leaving tonight? I can't believe there's even a flight? Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 red-eye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.
M.
back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned.
Easy breezy! Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now.
You flew all this way.
Have some perspective.
You have some perspective! I'm sorry.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm stressed.
Okay, I need to calm down.
Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
Ugh, who is that? Hold up.
My dad said that? Yeah, Jean-Ralphio.
He told me that I had screwed you - out of my business - What? So he was gonna screw me back.
Any idea why he'd believe such a thing? That is so weird.
That is so-- oh, you know what? Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it.
I actually told him that Rent-A-Swag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.
Why would you say that? Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again.
Ohand I don't know if this is relevant - Hmm.
- But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.
That's probably not relevant, though.
It's probably not relevant, though.
- I don't know-- - I guess-- All this lying about me stops now! - Hmm.
- This is my life.
Please, one of you has to tell him the truth.
- Not it! - Not it! Ooh, you got me! Whoa ho! Uh-oh, uh-oh! - Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
Okay, fine.
You know what? I'm gonna do the unthinkable.
I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father.
Thank you.
Oh, that's a big cheering section.
Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia.
She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler.
I love her.
Oh, hi.
You must be Leslie Knope.
I'm Ulee Danssen.
I'm one of the honorees.
Wow, look at your face.
What? - It's just so symmetrical.
- Oh, thanks! You know, we all have that in Denmark.
Oh, you're from Denmark, of course.
Wow, what part of Denmark are you from? I'm from Silkeborg.
You know.
It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me.
And look what they've done for me.
- They made a statue of you! - Yes.
Wow.
Is that goat cheese? Good cheese eye, Leslie.
It is made out of goat cheese.
We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers.
They just love me.
What about your town? Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me.
And they're trying to kick me out of office.
One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right? I don't, no.
So you're from Mongolia? Will you take me with you when you go back there? I love you.
Hmm.
Did you understand that? Did you bring any wolverines? Say it again.
Say it again.
Alu-min-ium.
Okay, okay.
You say it.
You say it.
You say it.
It's "alumilum.
" - "Alumilum"? - Okay.
- Alumilum! - Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program, - I would be happy to - Mm-hmm.
But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there.
Yes, of course.
The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing.
- Me neither.
- I'm sorry? My family has a huge amount of money.
We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land.
Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days.
What? That's awesome.
It was awesome.
There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yo-yo.
Well, do you-- do you have it here? - Guys-- - The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad.
If I may, ours is great.
Brilliant! I'm in.
What? Are you serious? Yeah.
I like you, I like music.
On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do.
Oh, well, that actually may be tough.
I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to-- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, I meant Andy.
I want Andy to stay.
Is that a goose that just flew by the window? Oh, it's a plastic bag.
Did you see that? Wait, did I interrupt? What are you guys talking about? Let's see if it was a goose.
I think it could have been, honest to God.
Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved.
Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me.
It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious.
- Hey.
- Hey! How was your meeting? Good.
I'll fill you in later.
Are you ready for your speech? Uhyeah.
Yeah.
Thank you, Ulee.
It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.
Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope.
First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.
You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
I mean, they're just truly You know, I've been a public servant for a long time.
And you know how I spend my days? Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
And I love my town, but you know how they repay me? By hating me.
They hate me.
They want to recall me.
I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
You're always welcome in Silkeborg! Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie.
See? They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there.
I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks.
The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit.
You know, I'm sick of it.
Pawnee is filled with a bunch of pee-pee-heads.
Thank you very much for this amazing award.
I'm sorry I said "pee-pee-heads.
" Whoo! That's my boss! That speech was a little rough, don't you think? Whatever, it's how I feel.
Stupid, ungrateful town.
Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away.
- Hello.
- Leslie, it's Jerry.
Jerry who? Gergich.
Jer--oh, Jerry.
Jerry, why are you calling me? I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.
Everyone saw it.
What do you mean, "everyone"? I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.
She's calling it the "Pee-pee-head" speech.
- Bloody hell, Jerry! - So how's Lond-- I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.
It's a very special day.
Okay.
Hi, Donna.
So You're pregnant.
Oh, man, Tom told you.
Nope.
You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empire-waist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling.
I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks.
My goodness, you're observant.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Hmm.
When did you make the switch to boxer briefs? Yesterday.
Okay, please stop looking at him.
Why are we here? Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism.
You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not.
Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here.
When your kid screams "I hate you," you don't sink to his level and yell "I hate you" back.
You have to be the grown-up.
You're right.
I know.
I have to be the grown-up.
But it's so hard! Ron! God! And nobody ever thanks you.
You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you.
And by the way, April thanked you.
She nominated you for this award.
Well, April does that all the time.
She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
April respects you, and so do many others.
Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.
That way lies madness.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many.
A train ticket? You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent? Yes, you do.
If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen? This is London, Ron.
There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops.
Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first.
Hey, Jerry.
I didn't know you were working today.
Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away.
Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint-- That's great.
Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting.
Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby.
Oh, my God, that's wonderful news! Oh, there's so much in front of you.
I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time! That sounds terrible.
Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight.
Yeah.
You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris.
I'm very sad.
Please stop talking.
And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in.
- Ohh.
- That is exciting.
Mmm.
Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think.
The babies can sense it.
You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple.
Mm, mm.
Gimme, gimme.
Mm, mm, mm.
I want milk! Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Ohh.
Life is a miracle.
Mm, mm, mm.
So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, I can't do it, obviously.
Why? I don't even know what I would be doing.
I mean, besides, this is England.
Everything is so weird.
It's all different.
Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road.
Do they? I'll be damned.
Yeah, like that.
That's what I'm-- exactly what I'm talking about.
Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to? Not even a circus.
There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns.
One bearded lady.
She got all rude when I marveled at her.
Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy? Oh, he's awesome.
He's everything you would want in a boss.
I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny.
Total package.
I think you should do it.
When are you gonna have another opportunity like this? - I mean-- - And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay? Remember, I was in Washington last year.
He said he wanted me to head up the company.
I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.
Hey.
You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.
Come on, you can hack this.
I believe in you.
But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies.
Seems like the only logical solution.
My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant.
And I'm the baby daddy! How wonderful for you.
You don't seem very excited for us.
I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work.
Man, I thought this would be more satisfying.
I agree.
Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet? Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days.
This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race.
I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go.
I am not gonna let you go.
Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work.
Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods.
That's for a hangover.
Right, yeah, of course.
I'm so goofed-up right now.
I'm so jet-lagged.
I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called "Zapvigil," which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake.
So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab.
Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding.
I know it's Ann.
We are so glad you're back.
We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for.
And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones.
- Ohh.
- Anyway, welcome home! Don't pinch me! Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting.
It's really a dream come true.
Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say.
Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company.
He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening.
So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened? Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is! So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won Trophies I bought I also have something to say.
I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life.
I know this and I love you.
I love you too, daddy.
Money, please! My money.
Dr.
Saperstein, your son is my best friend.
- Yeah.
- He's like a brother to me.
But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum.
- Mm.
- On an island - Ooh.
- In space.
Hold on These two have been huge disappointments to me.
Come on, you love us.
Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets.
Dad! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me! But seriously, what are we doing here, though? - What are we doing here, dad? - Like, what is this? - Why are we here? - So So now you know the truth.
Will you back off? No, I will not stop.
Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now.
Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off.
I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night? - Yes! - Yes, daddy.
Huh? Blow me a kiss.
Mwah! - Mwah.
- Caught it.
I love you, daddy! - Me too.
- I love you, daddy! Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone? Yeah, we'll be fine.
Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here? - April - What? I don't trust him.
I never have.
- He's after your money.
- Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy.
Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia.
Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world.
Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs.
You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away.
Isn't that great? I didn't want all the slugs gone.
I wanted most of them gone! Sorry.
Well, we'll put one slug back.
Either way, your problem is solved.
Oh, my God, that lady is the worst.
She didn't even say thank you.
That's not why we do this, April.
We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause.
Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out? Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all.
But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
All right.
On to the next complaint.
Where the hell are you sending me, Knope? Morning, cutie.
Morning, Jessica.
Whoa.
These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington.
He was very impressed with you two.
He sounded rich on the phone.
I think he was calling me from a helicopter.
Could be.
He owns two.
So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.
I hope he's okay.
He sent me an email this morning.
I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.
Yeah, this isn't right.
None of this looks familiar.
Eddie? Uh-oh, Spaghettios.
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust.
No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase.
Oh, my.
Okay.
Come on, Sugarbutt! Oh, which one's Sugarbutt? That's you! Come on.
We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt.
Wildly inappropriate.
Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up? I doubt it.
He never gives up on anything, except for my mom.
When she turned 30, he was like, "Get out!" Maybe I should just throw in the towel.
Your dad'll destroy me.
I'll be left with nothing.
Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.
Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.
First of all, unbelievable analogy.
Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man.
When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher.
You're right.
I mean, I'm basically Babyface.
You're basically Babyface! Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad.
That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way.
Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies.
I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.
- You want to come? - No! I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know? You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive.
Isn't that wild? It is.
A green olive.
A little high in sodium.
I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.
- Our baby's not a salad.
- Yes, right.
It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing.
Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs.
It's still just our thing.
It'll always be just our thing.
That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.
You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl.
I prefer "Chickpea.
" Because it's lower in sodium? - Yes, exactly.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you leaving? Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase.
Let's see, it is "48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon.
" Oh, brother.
Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you.
I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours.
So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face.
- Okay? - Okay.
Please sit.
"Dear award committee members" Leslie, I didn't even start.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
"Dear award committee members, "where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, "people who don't care at all about what they do "or how they do it.
"They let the world wash over them "and barely notice anyone else is even there.
"Leslie Knope is not one of these people.
"She cares about everything and everyone in our town.
"I don't know how she does it.
"People come to her with the pettiest, "stupidest problems, "and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- "what happens to them.
"And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, "your life gets better every day.
"She spends every waking moment thinking "of new ways to make her friends happy.
"There is something wonderful about seeing someone "who has found her true purpose on earth.
"For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut "or a hot dog-eating champion.
"For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, "is making people's lives better.
"That's what I love about her, "and that's why she deserves this award.
"Sincerely Satan.
" You're getting hugged right now.
No, I told you not to.
- I'm giving you a hug.
- No! Stay away! No! All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.
But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption.
This is worth the trip.
"Dear Ron, "you have now reached the cliffsides "overlooking the islands.
"As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, "please read out loud the poem "by the great Scotsman Robert Burns.
Love, Leslie.
" "Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, "with purple blossoms to the spring, "and I, a bird to shelter there, "when wearied on my little wing, "how I would mourn when it was torn "by autumn wild and winter rude, "but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed.
" I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.
- Nice to be home.
- It is.
But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing.
And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.
Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.
Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it.
Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons.
You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts.
We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.
Yeah.
Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.
Mm.
I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
- Oh.
- Wear it for me.
- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.
All right.
What's up? No, not sexy.
Failed experiment.
Take it off.
- Okay, just--okay.
- Just take it off.
No.
Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job.
Leslie, this is ridiculous.
It's your job.
Take it.
Well, I should have to interview - just like everyone else.
- Mm.
Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years.
I know.
I was your boss.
I also walked you down the aisle at your wedding.
Take the job and leave me alone.
Come on, Ron.
Just interview me.
- No special treatment.
- Okay, fine.
What do you believe should be the ultimate goal of this department? The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life-- What are you writing? Is it good? What do you think is the best use of our yearly budget? It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
I'm sorry, Ms.
Knope, the correct answer is "Give it all back to the taxpayers.
" It seems you and I have fundamentally different philosophies.
Frankly, it's a miracle we ever worked together without killing each other.
- Good day.
- Ha, ha, okay.
No more goofing around.
Just tell me I have the job.
I have a lot of other people to meet with.
- I'll be in touch.
- Ron, come on, it's me.
Give me special treatment.
Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room.
What's this? Oh, it shows everyone's spirit dogs.
- That one's you.
- You guys think I'm a border collie? So obviously a cocker spaniel.
The spirit dog committee ruled on that weeks ago.
- There is no appeals process.
- No.
Totally.
I'm in on the joke.
I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working.
Classic border collie.
Has to control everything.
Totally.
First on the agenda: I'm gonna bring my lemonade stand idea to the small business coalition, and a little birdie told me it's already in the bag.
- Can I get a what-what? - What? - What? - Thank you.
No.
What idea? The fella who runs the hot stew stand in Lafayette Park is retiring, so Pawnee's new business liaison--Tom-- went out and got the Indiana Brothers juice company to rent it out as a lemonade stand.
Wow.
Plus, I downloaded this dope app that pops champagne whenever I say something awesome.
- Tom, that's great.
- I know.
- And it was only 9 bucks.
- No, I mean, the lemonade-- never mind.
Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research.
Don't sweat it, Lez-kno.
Tommy's taking care of every last detail.
Nothing I can do to help? Okay.
Oh.
I can straighten this for you.
There we go.
Oh, Larry.
We've been taking pictures all over City Hall to show our unborn baby where we met.
- Would you mind? - Oh, my gosh.
I would be honored.
Say, when are you crazy kids gonna get hitched? Well, you know, actually, we haven't discussed it in a while.
No, it's kind of taken a back seat.
Well, you know, to each his own, but you guys really seem like you're in love.
And when I see a couple who look at each other the way you do, I don't know, it just makes me think that maybe this crazy world is gonna be okay.
That literally went on forever.
I thought you were never gonna stop talking.
But now that you have Ann Perkins, will you marry me? Wow.
Cracker dust.
Uh, I mean, yes, of-- of course, l-let's do it.
Can I have a sip of your water, please? Oh, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm a bit of a germaphobe.
Oh, no, no, totally understand.
Ann Perkins I'm gonna cough it out.
I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I love you.
I love you too.
No part of this is how I pictured it.
I thought another cracker might push it through, but I was wrong.
- Let's do this right.
- Yeah.
Let's go get an engagement ring.
Yes.
That was a beautiful moment.
- Hello, France! - Mm.
You guys enjoying that cheese? It's unpasteurized.
What's that mean? - Unpasteurized? - I don't care.
I don't care.
Technically, it's illegal in this country.
I smuggled it back from Paris.
Anyway, I want you guys to think of my office as a clubhouse, total open-door policy.
I wanna be your friend as well as your boss.
What the hell is wrong with you? Are you in a cult? Can I join? - Let's sacrifice Larry.
- Oh, April.
It's my first day as city manager, so I'm holding open office hours to break the ice.
Now, Chris was always the nice guy that made everyone happy, while I brought down the hammer.
But now that he's gone, I kind of have to do both.
Everyone is the best.
We're cutting vacation time.
Let's eat vitamins.
This is exhausting.
Listen real quick.
I have some super cool new rules - Oh, nice.
- That are also super mandatory.
Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore? - Are you serious? - That's right.
Massive time waster.
Kills productivity.
Hey, sanitation.
Listen, let's talk health insurance.
Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Have some illegal cheese.
No cell phone usage on City Hall property? That's not fair, my cell phone is how I avoid doing work.
Bathroom breaks should be limited to five minutes? I can't shower in five minutes.
See, he's acting all loosey-goosey, but that little dude's wound so tight, - he's gonna pop.
- Hey, sanitation sanitation in the house tonight Oh, what happened to our spirit dogs? I came up with a way better game.
Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Tom, you are a blue flyer.
So am I.
So are you and Donna.
And look at Ron.
Look at Ron.
I mean-- Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer? There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Either way, hell of a game, right, guys? Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System? Yeah, once you got on the city council, - we kinda stopped doin' that.
- What? Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System.
It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
- It is my very soul.
- Well, I have my own system.
Step one: Chill out a bit.
Step two: Get up there and rip it.
That's your plan? To--to rip it? Leslie, this is Tom's project.
Perhaps you should let him do things his way.
Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it.
I think that's better than going with a tried and true that led to-- and I quote-- "The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, over-prepared presentation that we've seen.
" And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage.
Fine, I'll go back to your system.
- You're the big dog around here.
- Big kangaroo.
And thank you.
Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house.
I invented this parks game, son.
Oh.
Damn it! When did they put a lamp here? Hey.
The boys in blue? Ah, what can I do for you for? We got a tip about some food entering the country illegally.
No--no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Thi--it's just cheese, guys.
Uh, I got it in France.
Okay.
Did you declare it on your customs form when you reentered the country? We're gonna need you to come down to the station.
I'm sure that's not necessary.
Let's just-- this is really good cheese.
- You should try some.
- Are you trying to bribe us? No! Oh, God.
I surrender.
- Step forward.
- Okay, okay.
There you go.
This is so exciting.
Hi, folks.
When's the big day? I assume this is a, you know Oh.
No.
This isn't a shotgun wedding, although, yes, she is pregnant, and, yes, we did just decide to get married today.
We haven't told our families or chosen a venue, but it's not a shotgun wedding.
We've been planning ours for months.
You wouldn't believe how much there is to do.
Invitations, table settings, color scheme, dance lessons.
And that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
Oh.
Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
That sounds elaborate.
All we did was punch "jewelry store" into our car GPS.
You remember that romantic moment, Chris? I was getting gas.
No, I don't remember it.
Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed.
Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Yeah, flipped through it.
Looks good.
Huh.
You're lying.
I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken.
Whose hair is that? It's brown.
Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation.
Au contraire.
I'm working on it right now.
And what's the most important part of a presentation? - Content.
- The presentation.
Okay.
Tom, you need hard data.
You need facts to make your case.
And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
You know, a classic ha-ha-hmm.
Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay? I got this.
Okay, fine, I trust you.
But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb.
- What's that? - Nothing, good luck.
- This is an elk hair.
- Yes.
It's the most effective hair for binder security.
You know that, Ron.
If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department.
I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen.
We've got a couple of customs agents coming down from the border, and they are not happy.
I can't believe this.
I never break the law.
- I've never even jaywalked.
- Never? I mean, I-I-I-- everyone does it sometimes.
Just add that to the charges.
Well, well, well, we got a hit on your prints.
Seems you're wanted for tax fraud in Colorado? What? I've never even been to Colorado.
I mean, I had a layover in Denver once.
Man, you can't keep your story straight, can you? - Come on! - Oh.
Here comes the customs guys now.
Fellas, he's all yours.
You're pranked.
You gotta see the stupid look on your face.
Check this out.
I took a picture.
- Classic! - You seemed a little uptight.
Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.
Wow.
Thi--you got me.
Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison Ah, that's super funny, you scamps.
Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider.
What do you say? Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do.
I don't know.
I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies.
I was thinking about getting into bisques.
Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years.
Retirement is for the birds.
You're gonna be so bored.
I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Screw bisque.
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Yeah.
What now? What do I do? Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about.
I'll take care of it.
You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Thanks, Leslie.
This calls for a toast.
Susan? Stew flutes, please.
Ah.
To stew.
Mm.
Oh, my God.
- That's very hot.
- Mm-hmm.
Congratulations.
This is a beauty.
If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band.
That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet.
We could engrave "2014" - or "TBD.
" - Hang on.
If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason.
When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people.
Right? I mean, we're having a child together.
We're moving to a new city.
You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.
That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a never-ending roller coaster of emotion.
I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other? That is so beautiful.
Theodore, we would like to return that ring.
And get a refund, please.
Maybe we should talk this over too.
- Oh, come on.
- Think what we could do if we didn't buy this ring.
I mean, this could go towards buying a house.
You have a lovely store.
- Hey, boss? - Hey.
I was just printing out my minesweeper high score, and I noticed this memo.
You're punishing us for the prank? No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's just like a warning memo.
Like, "Hey, all in good fun, "but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended.
" - That kind of thing.
- Listen.
I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior.
- What? - I feel like you're blowing it.
If you want people to like you, you have to play along.
Don't punish Donna and April.
Prank them back.
I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank.
Dude, okay.
Well, I could help you.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
I once did the best prank of all time.
I dumped all of my boss's action figures - into a fish tank.
- Yeah, that was me.
And I didn't really like it.
Classic.
Great news, guys.
- I just saved your bacon.
- Impossible.
You don't even know where it is.
I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement.
- So pressure's off.
- What? - I spent a lot of time on this.
- Doin' what, - putting mousse in your hair? - It's a gel-based serum.
Second of all, who uses mousse still? Oh, God.
Leslie.
Let's put our differences aside for a second.
Friend to friend, do you still use mousse? No, I use the juicy space thing--whatever you do.
The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom.
Stu's sales are flat.
Lemonade's the future.
I'm still doing my presentation.
I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Yeah.
I didn't think so.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me "Mr.
Perkins.
" Yeah, that makes me feel weird too.
Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore.
"Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore.
" Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment.
Okay, you're all set.
Credit card's been fully refunded.
Perfect timing.
We are going to buy this ring.
Charge it.
Ann Perkins, will you marry me? - I don't know! - Me either! - Maybe let's not? - Yeah, I think maybe not.
Okay.
Ring's yours again.
Hello? Actually, we don't want the ring.
Unbelievable.
Leslie, look.
I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this? Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up.
Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil? The botched laser show? Larry still can't see purple.
That was Larry's fault.
He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
I know, but still, Tom is all flash - and no substance.
- That's the old Tom.
You've been gone for a while, Leslie.
Tom has changed.
He ran a business, sold it for a profit.
He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you.
At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job.
You guys.
You guys.
- Be cool.
- What's going on? I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand.
I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now.
Here he is.
Just be cool.
Hey, guys.
What's up? Um, oh, I just remembered.
Can I show you something out to the front area? And leave your cell phones because of no reason.
Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally.
Okay, here we go to the parking lot now.
Wow, this is really sad.
Yep, follow to me, guys.
Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.
Sorry, can't go through with this.
I was gonna pull a prank.
- No! - Yeah.
I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero.
They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, "Hey, you get pranked much?" What the? I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word.
And that's when I would push this button.
No, no, no, no, no! Oh, my God.
You got blood all over me.
Thank you.
I mean it.
- Ben, that was amazing.
- Really? Best prank ever.
I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in.
Oh, how old is your son? Just pick a thing.
Honey, look at this.
This is what I want.
I don't want a ring.
I don't want a wedding.
I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.
I mean, we've never been traditional.
We made out the first night we ever met.
And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you.
Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now.
And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love.
We've never been very conventional, so why start now? Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket.
How much? Just take it and get outta here.
- Thank you! - Thanks.
We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.
Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction.
Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease? Well, frankly, it's because of Stu.
Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel.
And then he realized, "No, I wanna spend my time "in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat.
" Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle.
Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that.
Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Maybe we should make it five years.
Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal? I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
I think I've made a terrible mistake.
Okay, that was bleak.
Uh, Mr.
Haverford, you have a presentation as well? Hey.
Rip it.
There's nothing more American than lemonade.
Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.
And now you can.
Check under your seats.
Heh, hey.
Has my name on it.
Yes, it does.
Classic for you, Carter.
Darva, yours is a pink lemonade.
- I know you love that.
- Because I like pink.
That's right.
Now, who here likes laser shows? Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.
The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.
My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.
Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee.
Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But--you know, I want you to like me.
But I-I also really need you to respect me.
I respect you, little buddy.
Come here.
Mm, respect noogie.
Ah! We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.
We did it 'cause we love you.
R-e-s-p-e-g-c Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled.
- Yes.
- According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled.
Hey, Wyatt.
You were a good sport earlier.
No hard feelings? Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.
- Oh.
- It's a gel-based hair serum.
Enough with the mousse, for real.
Okay.
Well, Ron, you were right.
Tom has really grown up.
You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.
- Why? - Well, Tom's come into his own.
April runs Animal Control.
I mean, does this department even need me anymore? No.
We do not.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.
It's why I hired them.
Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.
This office can indeed function without you.
And soon, it'll have to.
Was that a death threat? We both know you're not gonna be here forever.
This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.
Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency.
Oh, that reminds me.
I know you don't open your mail, but I do.
And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month.
I mean, it has taken--
